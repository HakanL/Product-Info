*We're a small family business and we have just recently added the seat belt covers to our inventory.* We hope you love the product, and **it would mean the world to us if you could leave a review on Amazon for the product.**

There are two types of reviews you can leave with Amazon. One is for the product, and that helps other shoppers understand the quality and benefits of the product you have purchased. It's the most important review for us since a positive product review means you're satisfied with the product (if not please let us know so we can make it right!).

Here's the link to leave a product review: [Create Amazon Product Review](https://www.amazon.com/review/create-review/listing)


The other type is a seller review, and it is primarily to review the shipping and handling, a perfect score means you received the package in the expected time frame.
